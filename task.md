A search algorithm is a massive collection of other algorithms, each with its own purpose and task.
Entities Are Super Important
Further, it’s critical moving forward to understand that entities:
Play a massive role in search algorithms today.
Have their own algorithms.
Will play an ever-increasing role over time.
Knowing this will help you understand not just what content is valuable ( how close are those entities you’re writing about ? ) but also which links are likely to be judged more favorably.
And that’s just to name a couple of advantages.
How do search engines work ?
working of search  engines depend upon three main functions.

1. Crawling:
searches the web with automated programs called crawlers, looking for pages that are new or updated.stores those page addresses (or page URLs) in a big list to look at later. We find pages by many different methods, but the main method is following links from pages that we already know about.
2. Indexing:
visits the pages that it has learned about by crawling, and tries to analyze what each page is about. analyzes the content, images, and video files in the page, trying to understand what the page is about. This information is stored in the index, a huge database that is stored on many computers.
3. Serving search results:
When a user performs a search, tries to determine the highest quality results. The "best" results have many factors, including things such as the user's location, language, device (desktop or phone), and previous queries. For example, searching for "bicycle repair shops" would show different answers to a user in Paris than it would to a user in Hong Kong. doesn't accept payment to rank pages higher, and ranking is done algorithmically.
